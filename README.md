# File Handling Assignment

## Description
This Python script demonstrates file handling operations including file creation, reading, and appending, along with error handling using try-except blocks.

## Tasks

### File Creation
- Creates a new text file named "my_file.txt" in write mode ('w').
- Writes at least three lines of text to the file, including a mix of strings and numbers.

### File Reading and Display
- Reads the contents of "my_file.txt" and displays them on the console.

### File Appending
- Opens "my_file.txt" in append mode ('a').
- Appends three additional lines of text to the existing content.

### Error Handling
- Implements error handling using try, except, and finally blocks to manage potential file-related exceptions (e.g., FileNotFoundError, PermissionError).
